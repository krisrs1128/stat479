### Learning outcommes

- **Compare** the competing definitions of interpretable machine learning, the motivations behind them, and metrics that can be used to quantify whether they have been met.
- Within a specific application context, **evaluate** the trade-offs associated with competing interpretable machine learning techniques.
- **Describe** the theoretical foundation of intrinsically interpretable models like sparse regression, gaussian processes, and classification and regression trees, and **apply** them to realistic case studies with appropriate validation checks.

---

### Learning outcommes

- **Describe** the theoretical foundation of post-hoc explanation methods like SHAP and linear probes values and **apply** them to realistic case studies with appropriate validation checks
- **Analyze** large-scale foundation models using methods like sparse autoencoders and **describe** their relevance to problems of model control and AI-driven design.

### Problems

* Fairness
* Safety
* Misinformation

---

### Formulation gaps

- In machine learning, most effort is directed towards ensuring models have good
performance performance metrics on external benchmark data sets.

- Models learning this way can be very accurate according to easily measured
criteria like accuracy or computational efficiency but inappropriate with
respect to properties that are harder to measure.

- The gap between what we want our models to achieve and what we can easily
encode in performance metrics is called a formulation gap.

---

### Formulation gaps: Trust

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Would you be willing to relinquish control to the model?

- The answer depends on how it manages individual cases, not just than overall accuracy.

### Formulation gaps: Transferability

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Typical benchmarks randomly split data into training vs. test sets.

- Models are often used in settings that don't match those original training/test splits.

- The use of models might themselves change the distribution of the data (pneumonia example from before).

### Formulation gaps: Informativeness

- Models are often used to support discovery.  This is a different task than automation.

- While this is often an argument for using "white box" models, black boxes can still support discovery, e.g., by identifying similar cases in a medical diagnosis system.

---

### Formulation gaps: Ethics


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Models might amplify existing biases if only test accuracy is considered.

- Fairness metrics have been defined to help guard against this risk, but there is no universal metric for fairness. Interpretability can help address broader demands for transparency.

### Exercise 1 - 1

- Introduce yourself to your neighbors. What is your name and degree program? What are your areas of interest? How might interpretability or explainability be helpful in the work that you do?

- Have you encountered a situation in the past where you think interpretability or explainability would be useful? Describe the situation and your overall goals. How did you address them and are there any ways the approach could have been improved?

---

### PDR Framework

- Reference `r Citep(bib, "Murdoch2019")` also breaks the vague concept of "interpretability" down into precise elements which can be more formally evaluated.

- Together, this helps establish trust in the reliability of the results, which is important in interdisciplinary work.

- It also helps protect against unintended consequences that can arise after model deployment.
---

### PDR Framework: Accuracy

- **Predictive Accuracy**: The model-to-explain has to be accurate. There is not point "interpreting" a model that gives a poor approximation of reality.

- **Descriptive Accuracy**: The interpretation should be faithful to the model. This is the extent to which the explanation reflects what the black box actually learned, which is not necessarily the same as what it was designed to learn.

---

### The PDR Desiderata: Relevancy

- Interpretations don't exist in a vacuum. Like data visualizations, their complexity needs to be suitable to their audience.

- For example, we might give three different explanations of the same model depending on whether we are communicating with biologists, clinicians, or statisticians.

- Whether the outputs from interpretability outputs are relevant to their audience can be gauged by their adoption in specific scientific settings or how they are actually used by participants in user studies.

---

### Spectrum of evaluation

Reference `r Citep(bib, "rigorous_interpretability")` notes that new interpretability techniques can be evaluated at several levels.

- Functionally-grounded: Define computational proxy tasks that can be measured without studying real users.

- Human-grounded: Consider simplified tasks that can be solved by general audience members. This can involve crowdsourcing.

- Application grounded: Evaluate in the field with representative experts in a concrete end-use case.

---

### Phases of method development

- These different types of evaluation can inform one another. For example, we can define new proxy tasks based on the most challenging steps for experts.

- New methods that do well in computational proxies are worth investigating through user studies.

---

### Benchmarking

- Each of these types fo evaluation will come with their own performance metrics.

- We will revisit this question periodically as we introduce new methods and study the contexts in which they are worth applying.
