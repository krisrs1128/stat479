# 13. SHAP and Interventions

* binary data code example

* interventional view

* gaussian code example

---

### Learning outcomes

* Compare the competing definitions of interpretable machine learning, the motivations behind them, and metrics that can be used to quantify whether they have been met.

---

## Binary Data Example

---

### Data simulation

---

### Visualization

---

### Explanations

---

### Exercise (warmup for do-calculus)

---

## Interventional View

---

### Conditional expectation vs. do-operator

---

### Algorithmic interpretation

(sampling descriptions for a 2D (x1, x2))

---

### Geometric interpretation

---

### Application to SHAP

---

### DAG visualization - Conditional

---

### DAG visualization - Marginal

---

### What is the estimand?

Observational vs. interventional choices

---

## Gaussian Example

---

### Data simulation
