### 22. Applying Sparse Autoencoders

* application to case study

* handling "dead" atoms

* model safety and control

---

### Learning Outcomes

* Describe the theoretical foundation of post-hoc explanation methods like SHAP and linear probes values and apply them to realistic case studies with appropriate validation checks
* Analyze large-scale foundation models using methods like sparse autoencoders and describe their relevance to problems of model control and AI-driven design.
* Within a specific application context, evaluate the trade-offs associated with competing interpretable machine learning techniques.
