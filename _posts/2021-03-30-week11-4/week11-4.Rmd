1. We have used text data analysis to motivate and illustrate the use of topic
models. However, these models can be used whenever we have high-dimensional
count data^[In fact, topic models are an example of a larger family of models,
called mixed-membership models. All of these models generalize clustering, and
different variants can be applied to other data types, like continuous,
categorical, and network data.]. To illustrate this broad applicability, this
lecture will consider an example from gene expression analysis.

2. The dataset we consider comes from the [GTEX
consortium](https://www.gtexportal.org/home/datasets). A variety of tissue
samples have been subject to RNA-seq analysis, which measures how much of each
type of gene is expressed within each sample. Intuitively, we relate,
  	* Documents &rarr; Tissue samples
  	* Words  &rarr; Genes
  	* Word Counts &rarr; Gene expression levels
	
```{r}
x <- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/fd437om519i5mrnur14xy6dq3ls0yqt2.csv")
x
```
	
3. The goal here is to find sets of genes that tend to be expressed together,
because these co-expression patterns might be indications of shared biological
processes. Unlike clustering, which assumes that each sample is described by one
gene expression profile, a topic model will be able to model each tissue sample
as a mixture of profiles (i.e., a mixture of underlying biological processes).

4. As a first step in our analysis, we need to prepare a `DocumentTermMatrix`
for use by the topicmodels package. Since the data were in tidy format, we can
use the `cast_dtm` function to spreaed genes across columns. From there, we can
fit an LDA model. However, we've commented out the code (it takes a while to
run) and instead just download the results that we've hosted on Box.

```{r}
x_dtm <- cast_dtm(x, sample, gene, value)
#fit <- LDA(x_dtm, k = 10, control = list(seed = 479))
#save(fit, file = "lda_gtex.rda")
f <- tempfile()
download.file("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/ifgo6fbvm8bdlshzegb5ty8xif5istn8.rda", f)
fit <- get(load(f))
```

5. Let's extract the tidy topic and memberships data. For the memberships, we
will also join in the tissue from which each biological sample belonged.

```{r}
tissue_info <- x %>%
  select(sample, starts_with("tissue")) %>%
  unique()

topics <- tidy(fit, matrix = "beta") %>%
  mutate(topic = factor(topic))
memberships <- tidy(fit, matrix = "gamma") %>%
  mutate(topic = factor(topic)) %>%
  left_join(tissue_info, by = c("document" = "sample"))
```

5. We can now visualize the topics. Let’s consider the genes with the highest
discrimination between topics, using the same discrimination score as in the
previous notes. Each row in the heatmap below is a gene, and each column is a
topic. The intensity of color represents the gene's probability within the
corresponding topic. Since only discriminative genes are shown, it's not
surprising that most genes are only active within a subset of topics.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# same formula from previous notes
kl_div <- function(p1, p2) {
  p1 * log(p1 / p2) + (p2 - p2)
}

kl_mat <- function(p) {
  K <- matrix(0, nrow = length(p), ncol = length(p))
  
  for (i in seq_along(p)) {
    for (j in seq_len(i - 1)) {
      K[i, j] <- kl_div(p[i], p[j])
    }
  }
  K
}

discrepancy <- function(p, lambda = 1e-7) {
  p <- (p + lambda) / sum(p + lambda) # Laplace smoothing
  K <- kl_mat(p)
  max(K)
}
```

```{r, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 4.5, fig.cap = "A heatmap of the most discriminative genes across the 10 estimated topics."}
discriminative_genes <- topics %>%
  group_by(term) %>%
  mutate(D = discrepancy(beta)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  slice_max(D, n = 400) %>%
  mutate(term = fct_reorder(term, -D))

discriminative_genes %>%
  pivot_wider(term, topic, values_from = "beta") %>%
  column_to_rownames("term") %>%
  superheat(
    pretty.order.rows = TRUE,
    left.label.size = 1.5,
    left.label.text.size = 3,
    bottom.label.size = 0.05,
    legend = FALSE
  )
```

6. Now, let’s see what tissues are related to which topics. We can use a
structure plot. Before making the plot, we prepare the data appropriately.
First, there are some tissues with very few samples, so we will filter those
tissues away. Second, we will reorder the samples so that those samples with
similar topic profiles are placed next to one another. This is accomplished by
running a hierarchical clustering on the topic membership vectors and extracting
the order of the resulting dendrogram leaves.

```{r}
keep_tissues <- memberships %>%
  count(tissue) %>%
  filter(n > 70) %>%
  pull(tissue)

hclust_result <- hclust(dist(fit@gamma))
document_order <- fit@documents[hclust_result$order]
memberships <- memberships %>%
  filter(tissue %in% keep_tissues) %>%
  mutate(document = factor(document, levels = document_order))
```

7. Next, we can generate the structure plot. The first three lines are the key
lines: they create a stacked barchart for each sample and then facet across
tissues. The remaining lines simply refine the appearance of the plot.

```{r, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 5, preview = TRUE, fig.cap = "A structure plot, showing the topic memberships across all tissue samples in the dataset."}
ggplot(memberships, aes(gamma, document, fill = topic, col = topic)) +
  geom_col(position = position_stack()) +
  facet_grid(tissue ~ ., scales = "free", space = "free") +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set3", guide = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3") +
  labs(x = "Topic Membership", y = "Sample", fill = "Topic") +
  theme(
    panel.spacing = unit(0.5, "lines"),
    strip.switch.pad.grid = unit(0, "cm"),
    strip.text.y = element_text(size = 8, angle = 0),
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
  )
```

8. From this plot, we can see clearly that different tissues express different
combinations of topics. For example, pancreas tissue typically expresses genes
with high probability in topics 3 and 8. Further, within tissues, there can be
differences in the types of genes expressed -- certain blood cells are almost
entirely summarized by topic 1, but most require some mixture of topics 1 and 6.
Finally, we see that there are some topics that are common across several
tissues. For example, topic 4 is key component of thyroid, skin, muscle, lung,
and some brain tissue.
