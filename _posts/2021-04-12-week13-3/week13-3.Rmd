1. The previous notes gave us a look into the features learned by a deep
learning model. However, we could only look at one feature within one layer at a
time. We also only studied an individual image. If we want to better understand
the representations learned by a network, we will need ways of analyzing
collections of features taken from throughout the network, across entire
datasets.

2. This seems like an impossible task, but it turns out that, in real-world
models, the learned features tend to be highly correlated. Certain patterns of
activation tend to recur across similar images. This kind of structure makes it
possible to use clustering and dimensionality-reduction to begin to make sense
of the learned representations of individual networks.

3. To illustrate this idea, we will download the same model from before along
with a larger subsample of images used in training.

```{r}
f <- tempfile()
download.file("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/dxibamcr0bcmnj7xazqxnod8wtew70m2.rda", f)
images <- get(load(f))

f <- tempfile()
download.file("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/9wu6amgizhgnnefwrnyqzkf8glb6ktny.h5", f)
model <- load_model_hdf5(f)
```

4. The code block below save features from layers 6 and 8 from this model, for
all the images we downloaded. The code for extracting features is the same as
from the previous lecture, except instead of extracting features from all
layers, we're only considering these later ones. The reason we've focused on
these deeper layers is that (1) they are smaller, so we will consume less memory
on our computers, and (2) they correspond to the higher-level concepts which are
more difficult to understand directly, unlike the simple edge detectors in the
initial layers.

```{r}
l <- c(model$layers[[6]]$output, model$layers[[8]]$output)
activation_model <- keras_model(inputs = model$input, outputs = l)
features <- predict(activation_model, images)
```
5. ideally, we could work with a matrix of samples by features. the $ij^{th}$
element would be the activation of feature $j$ on observation $i$.

6. this is unfortunately not immediately available. as we saw before, each
feature map is actually a small array across spatial contexts, not a single
number. there is no single way to aggregate across a feature map, and it is
common to see people use the maximum, average, norm, or variance of a feature
map as a summary for how strongly that feature activates on a given image. we
will take the mean of activations.

```{r}
feature_means <- function(h) {
  apply(h, c(1, 4), mean) %>%
    as_tibble()
}

h <- map_dfc(features, feature_means) %>%
  set_colnames(str_c("feature_", 1:ncol(.))) %>%
  mutate(id = row_number())
```

7. Given this array, we can ask questions like, which neurons are most activated
for a particular image? or, which images induce the largest activations for a
particular neuron? In the block below, we find the 20 images that activate the
most for the third feature map in layer 6. This neuron seems to have learned to
recognize grass. Perhaps unsurprisingly, all the images are of dogs.

```{r, fig.height = 7, fig.cap = "The 20 images in the training dataset with the highest activations for neuron 3 in layer 6. This neuron seems to be sensitive to the presence of grass in an image (which happens to be correlated with whether a dog is present)."}
top_ims <- h %>%
  slice_max(feature_3, n = 20) %>%
  pull(id)

par(mfrow = c(5, 4), mai = rep(0.00, 4))
out <- images[top_ims,,,] %>% 
  array_tree(1) %>%
  map(~ plot(as.raster(., max = 255)))
```

8. This particular example should serve as a kind of warning. While it's easy to
imbue models with human-like characteristics, they often arrive at the answers
they need in unexpected ways. We asked the model to distinguish between cats and
dogs, but it is using whether the image has grass in it as a predictor. While
for this dataset this may be accurate, I would expect this model to fail on an
image of a cat in a grassy field.

9. Instead of only investigating one neuron, we can consider all the images and
neurons simultaneously. The code below makes a heatmap of the average feature
activations from before. Each row is an image and each column is a feature from
either layers 6 or 8. A similar example is given in the reading, where
coordinated views reveal that certain patterns of neuron activation encode the
lifts of the pen or specific curve shapes in a handwriting generation network.

```{r, fig.cap = "A heatmap of feature map activations for layers 6 and 8, across the entire dataset. Each row is an image, and each column is a neuron. There is limited clustering structure, but there are substantial differences in how strongly different neurons activate on average."}
superheat(
  h %>% select(-id),
  pretty.order.rows = TRUE,
  pretty.order.cols = TRUE,
  legend = FALSE
)
```

10. We can also apply clustering and dimensionality reduction ideas to understand
the collection of mean feature activations. For example, below we run $K$-means
across images, with the hope of finding images that are viewed similarly
according to the model. The 20 images closest to the centroid of cluster 3 are
printed below. It seems like the model has learned to cluster all the orange
images together^[Sometimes, it's just looking at the color of the floor!]. This
is a little surprising, considering that there are both cats and dogs that are
orange, so this isn't a particularly discriminating feature. It also suggests a
way to improve the model -- we could train it on recolorized input images, so
that it is forced to discover features that are unrelated to color^[In the deep
learning community, this would be called using color augmentation to enforce
invariance.].

```{r, fig.height = 7, fig.cap = "The 20 images closest to the centroid of cluster 3 in the feature activation space. This cluster seems to include images with many orange pixels."}
sub <- function(x) {
  select(x, starts_with("feature"))
}

cluster_result <- kmeans(sub(h), centers = 25, nstart = 20)
centroids <- tidy(cluster_result)
D <- pdist(sub(centroids), sub(h)) %>%
  as.matrix()

par(mfrow = c(5, 4), mai = rep(0.00, 4))
near_centroid <- order(D[3, ])[1:20]
out <- images[near_centroid,,, ] %>%
  array_tree(1) %>%
  map(~ plot(as.raster(., max = 255)))
```

11. In general, we can treat the activations generated by a deep learning model
as themselves the object of data analysis. This can help us determine whether
the kinds of features that we want it to (high-level concepts, rather than just
colors or textures). It can also highlight instances where the model learns
features associated with concepts that we would rather it be invariant to (e.g.,
changes in season, variations in lighting).
