1. Partial dependence (PD) plots help answer the question, « How is feature $j$
used by my model $f$? » Slight variations on PD plots are useful for some
related followup questions,
  	* Has my model $f$ learned interactions between features $j$ and $j^{\prime}$?
  	* How do the models $f$ and $f^{\prime}$ differ in the way that they use feature $j$?
  	
2. The variants, called Grouped and Contrastive PD plots, reduce the original CP
profiles less aggressively than PD plots, but without becoming overwhelmingly
complicated.

### Interactions

3. We say that there is an interaction between variables $j$ and $j^{\prime}$ if
the relationship between $x_{j}$ and $y$ is modulated by variable $j^{\prime}$.
For example, in the figure below, the slope of cross-sections across $j$ depends
on $j^{\prime}$.

4. Using the language of CP profiles, the figure above means that the shape of
the CP profile in $j$ depends on the particular setting of $j^{\prime}$. This
motivates the use of Grouped PD profiles — we compute several PD profiles in
$j$, restricting attention to CP profiles whose value $x_{j^{\prime}}$ lies
within a prespecified range.

5. To illustrate, we revisit the CP profiles for age from the Titanic dataset.
Below, the profiles are grouped according to the class of the ticket holder. The
result shows that the relationship between age and survival was not the same
across all passengers. For all classes, there was a decrease in survival
probability for adults, but the dropoff was most severe for crew members.

```{r, fig.cap = "Grouping the CP profiles by ticket class reveals an interaction effect with age in the Titanic dataset."}
f <- tempfile()
download.file("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/nau695mppsoxx0f6bns1ieo7kh1bje0j.rda", f)
fit <- get(load(f))

data(titanic)
titanic <- titanic %>%
  select(-country) %>%
  na.omit()
x <- select(titanic, -survived)

explanation <- explain(model = fit, data = x, y = titanic$survived)
profiles <- model_profile(explainer = explanation, groups = "class")
plot(profiles, geom = "profiles", variables = "age") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  theme479
```

6. What should we do if there are many input variables and we don’t have a
priori knowledge about which variables $j^{\prime}$ might be interacting with
$j$? One idea is to try to *discover* relevant interactions by clustering the
original set of CP profiles.

7. In more detail, we can compute the CP profiles for all the samples, and then
see whether there are subsets of profiles that all look similar. If we find
features $j^{\prime}$ that characterize these groupings, then we have found
features that interact with $j$ (with respect to the fitted model $f$). The plot
below shows the same profiles as above, but clustering directly. It seems to
recover the interaction between age and class, even though we have not
explicitly provided this grouping variable.

```{r, fig.cap = "Discovered groupings in the CP profiles for age reveals an interaction effect."}
profiles <- model_profile(explainer = explanation, variables = "age", k = 3)
plot(profiles, geom = "profiles", variables = "age") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  theme479
```

### Model Comparison

8. The comparison of different models’ PD profiles can be used to,
  	* Validate a simple model
  	* Guide the design of new features, and
  	* Characterizing overfitting
  	PD profiles that are used to compare different models are sometimes called
  	« Contrastive » PD profiles.
  	
9. To validate a simple model, we can compare its PD profiles with those of a
more sophisticated model. We will illustrate this by fitting linear and random
forest models to a dataset of apartment prices^[It is a simulated dataset, but
designed to reflect properties of a real dataset.]. Given various properties of
an apartment, the goal is to determine its price. The code below fits the two
models and extracts their CP and PD profiles.

```{r}
data(apartments)
x <- select(apartments, -m2.price)
profiles_lm <- train(x, apartments$m2.price, method = "lm") %>%
  explain(x, apartments$m2.price, label = "LM") %>%
  model_profile()
profiles_rf <- train(x, apartments$m2.price, method = "rf", tuneGrid = data.frame(mtry = 10)) %>%
  explain(x, apartments$m2.price, label = "RF") %>%
  model_profile()
```

10. The PD profile below shows that the random forest learns linear
relationships with price for both the surface and floor variables. If all the
effects were like this, then we would have a good reason for preferring the
linear model.

```{r, fig.cap = "A contrastive PD display suggests that the floor and surface features are linearly related with apartment price."}
plot(profiles_lm, profiles_rf, variables = c("surface", "floor")) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  theme479
```

11.. When making the comparison between a simple and a complex model, certain
discrepancies might become apparent. For example, important nonlinearities or
interactions might be visible from the PD profiles of the complex model. This
information can guide the design of new features in the simpler model, so that
it can continue to be used. This is exactly the case in the apartments dataset
above -- there is a strong nonlinear relationship for the construction year
variables. This suggests that, if a linear model is still desired, then a new
feature should be defined that identifies whether the apartment was built
between 1935 and 1990.

```{r, fig.cap = "The random forest learns a nonlinear relationship between construction year and apartment price. This suggests designing new features to include in the linear model."}
plot(profiles_lm, profiles_rf, variables = "construction.year") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  theme479
```

11. Suppose you have found that a model is overfitting (e.g., by finding that
it’s training error is much lower than its test error). One way to address this
overfitting is to compare the PD profiles between the simple and complex models.
If the profiles are very different for one of the features, then that feature
may be the source of overfitting.
