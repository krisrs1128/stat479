1. Clustering algorithms usually require the number of clusters $K$ as an
argument. How should it be chosen?

2. There are many possible criteria, but one common approach is to compute the
silhouette statistic. It is a statistic that can be computed for each
observation in a dataset, measuring how strongly it is tied to its assigned
cluster. If a whole cluster has large silhouette statistics, then that cluster
is well-defined and clearly isolated other clusters.

3. The plots below illustrate the computation of silhouette statistics for a
clustering of the penguins dataset that used $K = 3$. To set up, we first need
to cluster the penguins dataset. The idea is the same as in the $K$-means notes,
but we encapsulate the code in a function, so that we can easily extract data
for different values of $K$.

```{r}
penguins <- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/ijh7iipc9ect1jf0z8qa2n3j7dgem1gh.csv") %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  mutate(id = row_number())

cluster_penguins <- function(penguins, K) {
  x <- penguins %>%
    select(matches("length|depth|mass")) %>%
    scale()
    
  kmeans(x, center = K) %>%
    augment(penguins) %>% # creates column ".cluster" with cluster label
    mutate(silhouette = silhouette(as.integer(.cluster), dist(x))[, "sil_width"])
}
```

4. Denote the silhouette statistic of observation $i$ by $s_{i}$. We will
compute $s_i$ for the observation with the black highlight below^[You can change
`cur_id` to try different observations.].

```{r}
cur_id <- 2
penguins3 <- cluster_penguins(penguins, K = 3)
obs_i <- penguins3 %>%
  filter(id == cur_id)
```

```{r fig.cap = "The observation on which we will compute the silhouette statistic."}
ggplot(penguins3, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, col = .cluster)) +
  geom_point(data = obs_i, size = 5, col = "black") + 
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  scale_size(range = c(4, 1))
```

5. The first step in the calculation of the silhouette statistic is to measure
the pairwise distances between the observation $i$ and all observations in the
same cluster. These distances are the lengths of the small lines below. Call
average of these lengths $a_{i}$.

```{r fig.cap = "The average distance between the target observation and all others in the same cluster."}
ggplot(penguins3, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, col = .cluster)) +
  geom_segment(
    data = penguins3 %>% filter(.cluster == obs_i$.cluster), 
    aes(xend = obs_i$bill_length_mm, yend = obs_i$bill_depth_mm),
    size = 0.6, alpha = 0.3
  ) +
  geom_point(data = obs_i, size = 5, col = "black") + 
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  scale_size(range = c(4, 1)) +
  labs(title = expression(paste("Distances used for ", a[i])))
```

5. Next, we compute pairwise distances to all observations in clusters 2 and 3.
The average of these pairwise distances are called $b_{i2}$ and $b_{i3}$. Choose
the smaller of $b_{i2}$ and $b_{i3}$, and call it $b_{i}$. In a sense, this is
the "next best" cluster to put observation $i$. For a general $K$, you would
compute $b_{ik}$ for all $k$ (other than observation $i$'s cluster) and take the
minimum across all of them. In this case, the orange segments are on average
smaller than the blue segments, so $b_i$ is defined as the average length of the
orange segments.

```{r fig.cap = "The average distance between the target observation and all others in *different* clusters."}
ggplot(penguins3, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, col = .cluster)) +
  geom_segment(
    data = penguins3 %>% filter(.cluster != obs_i$.cluster), 
    aes(xend = obs_i$bill_length_mm, yend = obs_i$bill_depth_mm, col = .cluster),
    size = 0.5, alpha = 0.3
  ) +
  geom_point(data = obs_i, size = 5, col = "black") + 
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  scale_size(range = c(4, 1)) +
  labs(title = expression(paste("Distances used for ", b[i][1], " and ", b[i][2])))
```

6. The silhouette statistic for observation $i$ is derived from the relative
lengths of the orange vs. green segments. Formally, the silhouette statistic for
observation $i$ is $s_{i}:= \frac{b_{i} - a_{i}}{\max\left({a_{i},
b_{i}}\right)}$. This number is close to 1 if the orange segments are much
longer than the green segments, close to 0 if the segments are about the same
size, and close to -1 if the the orange segments are much shorter than the green
segments^[This last case likely indicates a misclustering.].

7. The median of these $s_{i}$ for all observations within cluster $k$ is a
measure of how well-defined cluster $k$ is overall. The higher this number, the
more well-defined the cluster.

8. Denote the median of the silhouette statistics within cluster $k$ by
$SS_{k}$. A measure how good a choice of $K$ is can be determined by the median
of these medians: $\text{Quality}(K) := \text{median}_{k = 1 \dots, K} SS_{k}$.

9. In particular, this can be used to define (a) a good cut point in a
hierarchical clustering or (b) a point at which a cluster should no longer be
split into subgroups.

10. In R, we can use the `silhouette` function from the cluster package to
compute the silhouette statistic.  The syntax is `silhouette(cluster_labels,
pairwise_distances)` where `cluster_labels` is a vector of (integer) cluster
ID's for each observation and `pairwise_distances` gives the lengths of the
segments between all pairs of observations. An example of this function's usage
is given in the function at the start of the illustration.

11. This is what the silhouette statistic looks like in the penguins dataset
when we choose 3 clusters. The larger points have lower silhouette statistics.
This points between clusters 2 and 3 have large silhouette statistics because
those two clusters blend into one another.

```{r, fig.cap = "The silhouette statistics on the Palmers Penguins dataset, when using $K$-means with $K = 3$."}
ggplot(penguins3) +
  geom_point(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, col = .cluster, size = silhouette)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  scale_size(range = c(4, 1))
```

12. We can also visualize the histogram of silhouette statistics within each
cluster. Since the silhouette statistics for cluster 2 are generally lower than
those for the other two clusters (in particular, its median is lower), we can
conclude that it is less well-defined.

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 8, fig.cap = "The per-cluster histograms of silhouette statistics summarize how well-defined each cluster is."}
ggplot(penguins3) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = silhouette), binwidth = 0.05) +
  facet_grid(~ .cluster)
```

13. If we choose even more clusters, then there are more points lying along the
boundaries of poorly defined clusters. Their associated silhouette statistics
end up becoming larger. From the histogram, we can also see a deterioration in
the median silhouette scores across all clusters.

```{r, fig.cap = "We can repeat the same exercise, but with $K = 4$ clusters instead."}
penguins4 <- cluster_penguins(penguins, K = 4)
ggplot(penguins4) +
  geom_point(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, col = .cluster, size = silhouette)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  scale_size(range = c(4, 1))
```

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 8}
ggplot(penguins4) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = silhouette), binwidth = 0.05) +
  facet_grid(~ .cluster)
```
