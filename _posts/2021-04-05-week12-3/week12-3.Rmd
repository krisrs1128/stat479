1. Exploratory data analysis and model building complement each other well. In
practical problems, visualization can guide us towards more plausible models.

2. We rarely know the exact form of a model in advance, but usually have a few
reasonable candidates. Exploratory analysis can rule out some candidates and
suggest new, previously unanticipated, relationships.

3. We will illustrate these ideas using an example. A researcher is interested
in monitoring the level of PM2.5, a type of small air particlute that can be bad
for public health. High quality data are available from weather stations
scattered around the world, but their data only apply locally. On the other
hand, low quality data, available from satellites, are available everywhere. A
model is desired that uses the weather station measurements to calibrate the
satellite data. If it works well, it could be used to monitor PM2.5 levels at
global scale.

```{r}
f <- tempfile()
download.file("https://github.com/jgabry/bayes-vis-paper/blob/master/bayes-vis.RData?raw=true", f)
GM <- get(load(f))
GM@data <- GM@data %>% 
  mutate(
    log_pm25 = log(pm25), 
    log_sat = log(sat_2014)
  )
```

4. The simplest model simply fits $\text{station} = a + b \times
\text{satellite}$ at locations where they are both available. This model was
used in practice by the Global Burden of Disease project until 2016.

```{r, fig.cap = "The relationship between satellite and ground station estimates of PM2.5."}
ggplot(GM@data, aes(log_sat, log_pm25)) +
  geom_point(aes(col = super_region_name), size = 0.8, alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  labs(
    x = "log(satellite)",
    y = "log(ground station)",
    col = "WHO Region"
  ) +
  coord_fixed()
```

5. However, when we plot these two variables against one another, we notice that
there is still quite a bit of heterogeneity. The residuals are large — what
features might be correlated with these residuals, which if included, would
improve the model fit?
  	* The error $\epsilon_{i}$ in a model $y_i = f\left(x_{i}\right) +
  	\epsilon_{i}$ represents out our ignorance of the myriad of unmeasured
  	factors that determine the relationship between $x$ and $y$.
	* For example, desert sand is known to increase PM2.5, but it is not visible
	from space. The residuals are probably correlated with whether the model is in
	a desert area (we underpredict PM2.5 in deserts), and so would be improved if
	we included a term with this feature.

6. One hypothesis is that country region is an important factor. Below, we fit
regression lines separately for different country super-regions, as specified by
the WHO. The fact that the slopes are not the same in each region means that we
should modify our model to have a different slope in each region^[Viewed
differently, this is like adding an interaction between the satellite
measurements and WHO region.].

```{r, fig.cap = "The relationship between these variables is not the same across regions."}
ggplot(GM@data, aes(log_sat, log_pm25)) +
  geom_point(aes(col = super_region_name), size = 0.4, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(aes(col = super_region_name), method = "lm", se = F, size = 2) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  labs(
    x = "log(satellite)",
    y = "log(ground station)",
    col = "WHO Region"
  ) +
  coord_fixed()
```

7. The WHO categorizations are somewhat arbitrary. Maybe there are better
country groupings, tailored specifically to the PM2.5 problem? One idea is to
cluster the ground stations based on PM2.5 level and use these clusters as a
different region grouping.

```{r, fig.cap = "We can define clusters of regions on our own, using a hierarchical clustering."}
average <- GM@data %>% 
  group_by(iso3) %>% 
  summarise(pm25 = mean(pm25))

clust <- dist(average) %>%
  hclust() %>%
  cutree(k = 6)

GM@data$cluster_region <- map_chr(GM@data$iso3, ~ clust[which(average$iso3 == .)])
ggplot(GM@data, aes(log_sat, log_pm25)) +
  geom_point(aes(col = cluster_region), size = 0.4, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(aes(col = cluster_region), method = "lm", se = F, size = 2) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  labs(
    x = "log(satellite)",
    y = "log(ground station)",
    col = "Cluster Region"
  ) +
  coord_fixed()
```

8. We now have a « network » of models. We’re going to want more refined tools
for distinguishing between them. This is the subject of the next two lectures.
