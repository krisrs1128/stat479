1. Topic modeling is a type of dimensionality reduction method that is
especially useful for high-dimensional count matrices. For example, it can be
applied to,
    * Text data analysis, where each row is a document and each column is a word.
    The $ij^{th}$ entry contains the count of the $j^{th}$ word in the $i^{th}$
    document.
    * Gene expression analysis, where each row is a biological sample and each
    column is a gene. The $ij^{th}$ entry measures the amount of gene $j$
    expressed in sample $i$.

2. For clarity, we will refer to samples as documents and features as words.
However, keep in mind that these methods can be used more generally -- we will
see a biological application three lectures from now.

3. These models are useful to know about because they provide a compromise
between clustering and PCA.
    * In clustering, each document would have to be assigned to a single topic.
    In contrast, topic models allow each document to partially belong to several
    topics simultaneously. In this sense, they are more suitable when data do
    not belong to distinct, clearly-defined clusters.
    * PCA is also appropriate when the data vary continuously, but it does not
    provide any notion of clusters. In contrast, topic models estimate $K$
    topics, which are analogous to a cluster centroids (though documents are
    typically a mix of several centroids).

4. Without going into mathematical detail, topic models perform dimensionality
reduction by supposing,
    * Each document is a mixture of topics.
    * Each topic is a mixture of words.

In an ordinary clustering model, the bars for the memberships would have to be either pure purple or orange.

```

5. To illustrate the first point, consider modeling a collection of newspaper
articles. A set of articles might belong primarily to the "politics" topic, and
others to the "business" topic. Articles that describe a monetary policy in the
federal reserve might belong partially to both the "politics" and the "business"
topic.

6. For the second point, consider the difference in words that would
appear in politics and business articles. Articles about politics might
frequently include words like "congress" and "law," but only rarely words
like "stock" and "trade."

7. Geometrically, LDA can be represented by the following picture. The corners
of the simplex^[A simplex is the geometric object describing the set of
probability vectors over $V$ elements. For example, if $V = 3$, then $\left(0.1,
0, 0.9\right)$ and $\left(0.2, 0.3, 0.5\right)$ belong to the simplex, but not
$\left(0.3, 0.1, 9\right)$, since it sums to a number larger than 1.] 
represent different words (in reality, there would be $V$ different corners to
this simplex, one for each word). A topic is a point on this simplex. The closer
the topic is to one of the corners, the more frequently that word appears in the
topic.

```{r, fig.cap = "A geometric interpretation of LDA, from the original paper by Blei, Ng, and Jordan.", echo = FALSE, out.width = 400, fig.align = "center"}

```

8. A document is a mixture of topics, with more words coming from the topics
that it is close to. More precisely, a document that is very close to a
particular topic has a word distribution just like that topic. A document that
is intermediate between two topics has a word distribution that mixes between
both topics. Note that this is different from a clustering model, where all
documents would lie at exactly one of the corners of the topic simplex. Finally,
note that the topics form their own simplex, since each document can be
described as a mixture of topics, with mixture weights summing up to 1.
