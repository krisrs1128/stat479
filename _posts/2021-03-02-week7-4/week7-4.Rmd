1. An important subtlety of geographic data visualization is that all our maps
are in 2D, but earth is 3D. The process of associated points on the earth with
2D coordinates is called « projection. » All projections introduce some level of
distortion, and there is no universal, ideal projection.

2. Here are a few examples of famous global projections. There are also many
projections designed to give optimal representations locally within a particular
geographic area.

3. This means that there is no universal standard for how to represent
coordinates on the earth, and it’s common to find different projections in
practice. For example, the block below shows how North America gets projected
according to two different CRSs.

```{r}
# some test projections, don't worry about this syntax
miller <- "+proj=mill +lat_0=0 +lon_0=0 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs"
lambert <- "+proj=lcc +lat_1=20 +lat_2=60 +lat_0=40 +lon_0=-96 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=GRS80 +datum=NAD83 +units=m +no_defs"

north_america <- world %>%
  filter(continent == "North America")

ggplot(st_transform(north_america, miller)) + geom_sf() 
ggplot(st_transform(north_america, lambert)) + geom_sf()
```


5. Both vector and raster spatial data will be associated with CRS’s. In either
`sf` or `raster` objects, they can be accessed using the `crs` function.

6. A common source of bugs is to use two different projections for the same
analysis. In this class, we will always use the EPSG:4326 projection, which is
what is used in most online maps. But in your own projects, you should always
check that the projections are consistent across data sources. If you find an
inconsistency, it will be important to « reproject » the data into the same CRS.
