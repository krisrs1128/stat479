1. So far, we’ve visualized neural networks by analyzing the activations of
learned features across observed samples. A complementary approach is to ask
instead — is there a hypothetical image that would maximize the activation of a
particular neuron? If we can construct such an image, then we might have a
better sense of the types of image concepts to which a neuron is highly
sensitive.

2. We will illustrate these ideas on a network that has been trained on
Imagenet. This is a large image dataset with many (thousands of) class labels,
and it is often used to evaluate image classification algorithms. The network is
loaded below.

```{r}
model <- application_vgg16(weights = "imagenet", include_top = FALSE)
```

3. The main idea is to setup an optimization problem that searches through image
space for an image that maximizes the activation for a particular neuron. The
function below computes the average activation of a one of the feature maps. The
goal is to find an image that maximizes this value for a given feature.

```{r}
mean_activation <- function(image, layer, ix=1) {
  h <- layer(image)
  k_mean(h[,,, ix])
}
```

4. To implement this, we can compute the gradient of a neuron’s average
activation with respect to input image pixel values. This is a measure of how
much the activation would change when individual pixel values are perturbed. The
function below moves an input image in the direction of steepest ascent for the
`mean_activation` function above.

```{r}
gradient_step <- function(image, layer, ix=1, lr=1e-3) {
  with(tf$GradientTape() %as% tape, {
    tape$watch(image)
    objective <- mean_activation(image, layer, ix)
  })
  grad <- tape$gradient(objective, image)
  image <- image + lr * grad
}
```
	
```{r fig.cap = "Starting from a random image, we can take a gradient step in the image space to increase a given neuron's mean activation.", echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/pdbsv8xg4qqxxhv6gqip40w0mck6bz3s.png")
```
	
5. Once these gradients can be computed, it’s possible to perform gradient
ascent to solve the activation maximization problem. This ascent is encoded by
the function below. We initialize with a random uniform image and then take
`n_iter` gradient steps in the direction that maximizes the activation of
feature `ix`.
	
```{r}
random_image <- function() {
  tf$random$uniform(map(c(1, 150, 150, 3), as.integer))
}

gradient_ascent <- function(layer, ix = 1, n_iter = 100, lr = 10) {
  im_seq <- array(0, dim = c(n_iter, 150, 150, 3))
  image <- random_image()
  for (i in seq_len(n_iter)) {
    image <- gradient_step(image, layer, ix, lr)
    im_seq[i,,,] <- as.array(image[1,,,])
  }
  
  im_seq
}
```

```{r, fig.cap = "Taking many gradient steps leads us towards an image that optimizes a neuron's activation.", echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/8zgkt3z6g00272q1e4phsa7nb9q61zib.png")
```
	
6. Below, we visualize the images that optimize the activations for a few
neurons in layer 3. These neurons seem to be most responsive particular colors
and edge orientations.

```{r, fig.cap = "The hypothetical images that maximize the activations for 40 different neurons. These neurons seem to pull out features related to color and edge orientations."}
squash <- function(x) {
  (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))
}

par(mfrow = c(5, 8), mai = rep(0.00, 4))
activation_model <- keras_model(inputs = model$input, outputs = model$layers[[3]]$output)
for (i in seq_len(40)) {
  im_seq <- gradient_ascent(activation_model, ix = i)
  plot(as.raster(squash(im_seq[100,,,])))
}
```

7. We can think of these features as analogous to a collection of basis
functions. At the first layer, the network is representing each image as a
combination of basis images, related to particular color or edge patterns.

8. We can compare these activation maximizing inputs with those associated with
later layers. It seems that the basis images at this level are more intricate,
reflecting textures and common objects across this dataset. For example, the
polka dot pattern may be strongly activated by cat eyes.

```{r, fig.show = "hold", preview = TRUE, fig.cap = "The results of the corresponding optimization for 40 neurons in layer 8."}
par(mfrow = c(5, 8), mai = rep(0.00, 4))
activation_model <- keras_model(inputs = model$input, outputs = model$layers[[8]]$output)
for (i in seq_len(40)) {
  im_seq <- gradient_ascent(activation_model, ix = i)
  plot(as.raster(squash(im_seq[100,,,])))
}
```
