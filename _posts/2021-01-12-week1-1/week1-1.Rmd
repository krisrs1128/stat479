This course explores the role of visualization within data science workflows.
We'll get hands-on experience how visualization can be used to support,

* Data cleaning and tidying
* Exploratory analysis
* Model inspection
* Scientific reporting

The course mostly uses R, though occasionally we will use the vega-lite library
in javascript. Prior experience with R, but not javascript, is expected.

In terms of content, we'll begin with a three week crash course on the
fundamental principles of data visualization. This will provide a vocabulary for
designing and critiquing visualizations throughout the semester. Weeks 4 - 5 are
focused on the connections between visualization and tidy data. Rearranging your
data in the right way can make it much easier to visualize; conversely, a good
interface can immediately highlight data quality issues.

From here on out, we'll focus on exploratory analysis and model visualization.
Weeks 6 - 8 consider data with temporal, geographic, or network structure --
each comes with its own visual conventions. Weeks 9 - 11 focus on visualization
of high-dimensional data, drawing from ideas in unsupervised learning. Weeks 12
and 13 describe the recent use of visualization to support inspection of complex
supervised models. We close with a discussion about the possibilities of
visualization in the broader intellectual landscape.

## Following along

You can really only learn visualization by practicing. For this reason, most of
the homeworks are technical exercises in building pre-defined visualizations (I
do hope you can exercise more creativity through your course project, though).
The homeworks will be much more approachable if you have already run all the
code accompanying the recordings. I recommend you have a window open for running
code while watching the recordings, pausing whenever you want to tinker with how
a particular line works.

The `.Rmd` files discussed in each recording are linked at the top of the post.
You should be able to run the `.Rmd` file directly on your computer -- if you
encounter any issues, don't hesitate to reach out. Observable notebooks that
reproduces figures discussed in the recordings are also linked at the top of
each post. See the Introduction to Vega-Lite
[lecture](https://mediaspace.wisc.edu/media/1_svnu2d3u) for a brief description
of how to reproduce examples in your own Observable notebooks.
