1. All the model visualization strategies weâ€™ve looked at in the last few
lectures have been dataset-wide. That is, we looked at properties of the
dataset as a whole, and whether the model made sense globally, across the whole
dataset. Individual observations might warrant special attention, though.

2. The block below loads in the fitted models from the previous set of notes.
		
```{r}
downloader <- function(link) {
  f <- tempfile()
  download.file(link, f)
  get(load(f))
}

models <- downloader("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/x7dotair443mhx34yzie3m3lrsvhk19a.rda")
GM <- downloader("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/2pzgdu7gyobhl5tezo63tns7by1aiy6d.rda")
```

3. A first diagnostic to consider is the leave-one-out predictive distribution.
This is the probability $p\left(y_{i} \vert y_{-i}\right)$ of sample $i$ after
having fitted a model to all samples except $i$. Ideally, most observations in
the dataset to have high predictive probability.
    * Note that this can be used for model comparison. Some models might have
    better per-sample leave-one-out predictive probabilities for almost all
    observations.
	* This is similar to a leave-one-out residual.
		
4. If we use rstan to fit a Bayesian model, then these leave-one-out
probabilities can be estimated using the `loo` function in the `loo` package.
The code below computes these probabilities for each model, storing the
difference in predictive probabilities for models two and three in the `diff23`
variable.

```{r}
elpd <- map(models, ~ loo(., save_psis = TRUE)$pointwise[, "elpd_loo"])
elpd_diffs <- GM@data %>%
  mutate(
    ID = row_number(),
    diff23 = elpd[[3]] - elpd[[2]]
  )

outliers <- elpd_diffs %>%
  filter(abs(diff23) > 6)
```

4. We plot the difference between these predictive probabilities below. The
interpretation is that Ulaanbataar has much higher leave-one-out probability
under the cluster-based model, perhaps because that model is able to group the
countries with large deserts together with one another. On the other hand, Santo
Domingo is better modeled by model 2, since it has higher leave-one-out
probability in that model.

```{r, fig.cap = "The difference in leave one out predictive probabilities for each sample, according to the WHO-region and cluster based hierarchical models."}
ggplot(elpd_diffs, aes(ID, diff23)) +
  geom_point(
    aes(col = super_region_name),
    size = 0.9, alpha = 0.8
    ) +
  geom_text_repel(
    data = outliers,
    aes(label = City_locality),
    size = 3 
  ) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  labs(
    y = "Influence (Model 2 vs. 3)",
    col = "WHO Region"
  )
```

5. Another diagnostic is to consider the influence of an observation. Formally,
the influence is a measure of how much the posterior predictive distribution
changes when we leave one sample out. The idea is to measure the difference
between the posterior predictives using a form of KL divergence, and note down
the observations that lead to a very large difference in divergence.

```{r, fig.cap = "Visual intuition about the influence of observations. If the posterior predictive distributions shift substantially when an observation is included or removed, then it is an influential observation.", echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/woojwyyqruo3wrkrhe5y28bz53rwjwng.png")
```

6. When using rstan, the influence measure can be computed by the `psis`
function. The `pareto_k` diagnostic summarizes how much the posterior predictive
shifts when an observation is or isn't included. For example, in the figure
below, observation 2674 (Ulaanbaatar again) is highly influential.

```{r, fig.cap = "The influence of each sample on the final posterior distribution."}
loglik <- map(models, ~ as.matrix(., pars = "log_lik"))
kdata <- GM@data %>%
  mutate(
    k_hat = psis(loglik[[2]])$diagnostics$pareto_k,
    Index = row_number()
  )
outliers <- kdata %>%
  filter(k_hat > 0.25)

ggplot(kdata, aes(x = Index, y = k_hat)) + 
  geom_point(aes(col = super_region_name), size = 0.5, alpha = 0.9) + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  geom_text_repel(data = outliers, aes(label = Index)) +
  labs(y = "k-hat")
```
