It might seem like we’re limited with the total number of variables we can
display at a time. While there are many types of encodings we could in theory
use, only a few them are very effective, and they can interfere with one
another.

Not all is lost, though! A very useful idea for visualizing high-dimensional
data is the idea of small multiples. It turns out that our eyes are pretty good
at making sense of many small plots, as long as there is some shared structure
across the plots.

Let's see these ideas in action. These are libraries we need.

```{r}
library("ggplot2")
library("dplyr")
library("dslabs")
library("readr")
theme_set(theme_bw())
```
In ggplot2, we can implement this idea using the `facet_wrap` and `facet_grid`
commands. We specify the column in the data.frame along which we want to
generate comparable small multiples.

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 3}
years <- c(1962, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2012)
continents <- c("Europe", "Asia")
gapminder_subset <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year %in% years, continent %in% continents)

ggplot(
    gapminder_subset, 
    aes(fertility, life_expectancy, col = continent)
  ) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(. ~ year) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```
In facet grid, you specify whether you want the plot to be repeated across rows
or columns, depending on whether you put the variable before or after the tilde.

```{r, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 8}
ggplot(
    gapminder_subset, 
    aes(fertility, life_expectancy, col = continent)
  ) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(year ~ .) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```
 
 
You can also facet by more than one variable at a time, specifying which
variables should go in rows and which should go in columns again using the
tilde.

```{r}
ggplot(
    gapminder %>% filter(year %in% years),
    aes(fertility, life_expectancy, col = continent)
  ) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(year ~ continent) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```
Sometimes, you just want to see the display repeated over groups, but you don’t
really need them to all appear in the same row or column. In this case, you can
use `facet_wrap`.

```{r}
ggplot(
    gapminder %>% filter(year %in% years),
    aes(x = fertility, y = life_expectancy, col = continent)
  ) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ year)
```
Just to illustrate, faceting makes sense for datasets other than scatterplots.
This example also shows that faceting will apply to multiple `geom` layers at
once.

The dataset shows the abundances of five different bacteria across three
different subjects over time, as they were subjected to antibiotics. The data
were the basis for [this study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20847294/).

```{r}
antibiotic <- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/5jmd9pku62291ek20lioevsw1c588ahx.csv")
head(antibiotic)
```

I have also separately computed running averages for each of the variables --
this is in the `svalue` column. We’ll discuss ways to do this during the week on
time series visualization.

```{r}
ggplot(antibiotic, aes(x = time)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = svalue), size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(aes(y = value, col = antibiotic), size = 0.5, alpha = 0.8) +
  facet_grid(species ~ ind) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  theme(strip.text.y = element_text(angle = 0))
```
It seems like some of the species are much more abundant than others. In this
situation, it *might* make sense to rescale the $y$-axis. Though, this is always
a risky decision -- people might easily misinterpret the plot and conclude that
the different species all have the same abundances. Nonetheless, it can't hurt
to try, using the `scale` argument to `facet_grid`.

```{r}
ggplot(antibiotic, aes(x = time)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = svalue), size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(aes(y = value, col = antibiotic), size = 0.5, alpha = 0.8) +
  facet_grid(species ~ ind, scale = "free_y") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  theme(strip.text.y = element_text(angle = 0))
```
Unlike the years example, the facets don’t automatically come with their own
natural order. We can define an order based on the average value of the
responses over the course of the survey, and then change the factor levels of
the `Species` column to reorder the panels.

```{r}
species_order <- antibiotic %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(avg_value = mean(value)) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_value)) %>%
  pull(species)

antibiotic <- antibiotic %>%
  mutate(species = factor(species, levels = species_order))

ggplot(antibiotic, aes(x = time)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = svalue), size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(aes(y = value, col = antibiotic), size = 0.5, alpha = 0.8) +
  facet_grid(species ~ ind, scale = "free_y") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  theme(strip.text.y = element_text(angle = 0))
```
